            Voxophone is an app that turns your singing and humming into a variety of musical instrument sounds - like a keyboard that you play with your voice.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            The idea for voxophone was born out of a problem that I faced. I can play guitar, but often the notes I play don't exactly match what I had intended to play. That's because playing an instrument usually requires several layers of translation. Think of a musical pitch. To play that note on an instrument, your mind must first map that pitch to a picture of the hand or finger positions needed to play that note on the instrument. That's the first translation. The second translation occurs when you actually try to apply those hand movements to your instrument in the real world.

        <p>
            For skilled musicians, this translation happens instantly with little thought. For those of us with less musical experience and practice, though, this is a significant hurdle to bringing musical ideas to the real world. The traditional solution to overcome this hurdle is to invest the time to practice playing the instrument. However, most people don't have the patience, interest, or drive to practice a musical instrument for hundreds or thousands of hours.

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Wouldn't it be great to eliminate those translation layers? The ideal instrument would read your mind to turn thoughts directly into music. It's possible to create such an instrument, but doing so will take significant time. Voxophone provides the next-best thing by letting you control instruments with your voice. This simplifies the translation to thinking of a note and then singing or humming it - something that comes quite naturally to people. Voxophone takes care of the second translation for you by converting your voice to the desired instrument.
