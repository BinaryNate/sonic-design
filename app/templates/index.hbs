            Voxophone is an app that turns your singing and humming into a variety of musical instrument sounds - like a keyboard that you play with your voice.

        <p>
            The idea for voxophone was born out of a problem that I faced. I can play guitar, but often the notes I play don't exactly match the notes I had intended to play. That's because playing an instrument usually requires several layers of translation. Think of a musical pitch. To play that note on an instrument, your mind must first map that pitch to a picture of the hand or finger positions needed to play that note on the instrument. That's the first translation. The second translation occurs when you actually try to apply those hand movements to your instrument in the real world.

        <p>
            For skilled musicians, this translation happens instantly and requires little thought. However, for those of us with less musical experience and practice, this is a significant hurdle to bringing musical ideas to the real world. The traditional solution to overcome this hurdle is to invest the time to practice playing the instrument, however most people don't have the patience, interest, or drive to practice for hundreds or thousands of hours.

            Wouldn't it be great?
